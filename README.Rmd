The only goal of `readODS` is to enable R to read and write OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) files. This package supports both ordinary ODS and "Flat ODS" (`fods`).

## Installation

Install the latest stable version from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("readODS")
```

from R-universe:

```r
install.packages("readODS", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

Or install the development version from Github:

```r
remotes::install_github("ropensci/readODS")
```

## Usage

In almost all use cases, you only need two functions: `read_ods` and `write_ods`. Simple.

#### Reading

```{r}
library(readODS)
read_ods("starwars.ods")
```

Reading from the 2nd sheet

```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", sheet = 2)
```

Reading from a specific range

```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", sheet = 2, range = "A1:C11")
```

Reading as a dataframe
```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", range="Sheet1!A2:C11", as_tibble = FALSE)
```

#### Writing

```{r}
## preserve the row names
write_ods(mtcars, "mtcars.ods", row_names = TRUE)
```

Appending a sheet

```{r}
write_ods(PlantGrowth, "mtcars.ods", append = TRUE, sheet = "plant")
```

```{r}
## Default: First sheet
read_ods("mtcars.ods")
```

```{r}
read_ods("mtcars.ods", sheet = "plant", range = "A1:B10")
```

### Maximum Sheet Size

**Reading** The maximum size of sheet you can read is determined by your machine's RAM.

**Writing** You can theoretically write sheets up to 16 384 columns by 1 048 576 rows (the current maximum sheet size in Excel and LibreOffice Calc). While larger ODS files than this are valid, they are not well supported. However older version of LibreOffice [(<=7.3)](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Faq/Calc/022) and Excel [(<=2003)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/use-excel-with-earlier-versions-of-excel-2fd9ffcb-6fce-485b-85af-fecfd651a5ac#:~:text=What%20it%20means%20Beginning%20with,lost%20in%20Excel%2097%2D2003.) have significantly smaller maximum sheet sizes, and so this should be considered when writing files for distribution.

Leeper, John Foster, Sergio Oller, Jim Hester, Stephen Watts, Arthur Katossky, Stas Malavin, Duncan Garmonsway, Mehrad Mahmoudian, Matt Kerlogue, Detlef Steuer, Michal Lauer, and Till Straube.

This package emulates the behaviours of `readxl::read_xlsx`, `writexl::write_xlsx` and `xlsx::write.xlsx`.

This package should be a silent member of `rio`, so that you don't need to care about file format any more.

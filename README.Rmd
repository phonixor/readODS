The only goal of readODS is to enable R to read and write OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) files.

## Installation

Install the latest stable version from CRAN: 

```r
install.packages("readODS")
```

from R-universe:

```r
install.packages("readODS", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

Or install the development version from Github:

```r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/readODS")
```

## Usage

In almost all use cases, you only need two functions: `read_ods` and `write_ods`. Simple.

#### Reading

```{r}
library(readODS)
read_ods("starwars.ods")
```

Reading from the 2nd sheet

```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", sheet = 2)
```

Reading from a specific range

```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", sheet = 2, range = "A1:C11")
```

#### Writing

```{r}
## preserve the row names
write_ods(mtcars, "mtcars.ods", row_names = TRUE)
```

Appending a sheet

```{r}
write_ods(PlantGrowth, "mtcars.ods", append = TRUE, sheet = "plant")
```

```{r}
## Default: First sheet
read_ods("mtcars.ods")
```

```{r}
read_ods("mtcars.ods", sheet = "plant", range = "A1:B10")
```

### About the speed and file size

This package is written entirely in R. Although the efficiency has been improved, please don't expect the heavily optimized performance of [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/), [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) and data.table's [fread](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table).

Also, this package can't handle ODS files larger than "medium size". See [issue #71](https://github.com/ropensci/readODS/issues/71).

If you need to read and write large ODS files efficiently, the [headless interface of LibreOffice](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Starting_the_Software_With_Parameters) is recommended. See [issue #49](https://github.com/ropensci/readODS/issues/49) for an example.

The creator of this package is Gerrit-Jan Schutten. The current maintainer is Chung-hong Chan. This package benefits from contributions by Thomas J. Leeper, John Foster, Sergio Oller, Jim Hester, Stephen Watts, Arthur Katossky, Stas Malavin, Duncan Garmonsway, Mehrad Mahmoudian, and Matt Kerlogue.

This package emulates the behaviors of `readxl::read_xlsx`, `writexl::write_xlsx` and `xlsx::write.xlsx`.

This package should be a silent member of `rio`, so that you don't need to care about file format anymore.
